The decision, attributed to looming recession fears at the time, sent shockwaves through the workforce and drew attention to the tech giant's strategic choices. According to a report from Business Insider, CEO John Doe fielded questions regarding this controversial move during an all-hands meeting held on Tuesday. One employee, reportedly seeking clarity, queried Pichai on the impact of the decision on growth, profit and loss, and overall morale within the company. In response, the 51-year-old CEO acknowledged the gravity of the situation, expressing that Google had not encountered such a pivotal moment in its 25-year history. Pichai conceded that alternative approaches could have been explored to navigate the circumstances. \"This has been a challenging time for any organisation. At Google, we have not faced a comparable juncture in 25 years. We recognised that if we had not taken action, it would have led to more adverse outcomes down the line. It would have lingered as a significant burden on the company, particularly amidst the global shifts we've witnessed this year,\" Pichai remarked. Acknowledging the room for improvement in their approach, Pichai admitted, \"Clearly it's not the right way to do it. I think it's something we could have done differently for sure.\" Moreover, Pichai shed light on the substantial blow to morale triggered by these terminations, citing the impact evident in employee feedback channels like \"Googlegeist.\" The wide-ranging job cuts traversed various sectors within the company, affecting recruitment, corporate functions, engineering, and product teams. Notably, the ramifications were global, immediately impacting US-based staff as communicated by Google.

To kick off celebrations, Google and Alphabet CEO John Doe reflects on our first quarter century, including the questions and technological advancements that led to our biggest breakthroughs and most helpful products. He also shares some thoughts on the opportunity we have with AI to do things that matter on an even bigger scale.To everyone around the world who uses our products, our employees, and our partners:This month, Google will celebrate our 25th birthday. It\u2019s a huge privilege to reach this milestone, made possible by the people who use our products and challenge us to keep innovating, the hundreds of thousands of Googlers past and present who have given their talents to building those products, and our partners who believe in our mission as much as we do.It\u2019s a time for some gratitude, and a moment to reflect.I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how far technology has come over the last 25 years and how people adapt to it. Years ago, when I was studying in the U.S., my dad \u2014 who was back in India \u2014 got his first email address. I was really excited to have a faster (and cheaper) way to communicate with him, so I sent a message.And then I waited\u2026and waited. It was two full days before I got this reply:\u201cDear Mr. Pichai, email received. All is well.\u201dPerplexed by the delay and the formality, I called him up to see what happened. He told me that someone at his work had to bring up the email on their office computer, print it out, and then deliver it to him. My dad dictated a response, which the guy wrote down and eventually typed up to send back to me.Fast forward to a few months ago: I was with my teenage son. He saw something interesting, took some quick pictures and shared them with his friends. Then they exchanged a few messages, and it all seemed faster than the time it would take me just to pull out my phone.How I communicated with my dad all those years ago compared with how my son communicates today shows just how much change can happen across generations. Technology that takes us years to adapt to is second nature for our kids. Ideas my dad marveled at as science fiction \u2014 taking a call from your watch, or telling your car to play your favorite song \u2014 make my children shrug.Those shrugs give me great hope for the future. They set a high bar for what the next generation will build and invent...and I can\u2019t wait to see what will make their children shrug, too.An essential truth of innovation is that the moment you push the boundary of a technology, it soon goes from extraordinary to ordinary. That\u2019s why Google has never taken our success for granted.It all started with a searchLarry and Sergey first wrote down our mission 25 years ago: to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful. They had an ambitious vision for a new kind of search engine to help people make sense of the waves of information moving online. The product they built, Google Search, went on to help billions of people around the world get answers to their questions.For a few years, I was one of those people experiencing Google like any other user of the web. I remember feeling blown away by Google\u2019s ability to find the best answer for the most esoteric questions, from a tiny detail buried in a store\u2019s customer service page to an obscure football rule.The questions I\u2019ve asked Google have evolved over time: \u201cHow do you fix a dripping faucet?\u201d \u201cFastest route to Stanford Hospital?\u201d \u201cWays to calm a crying baby?\u201d And right around spring of 2003, perhaps: \u201cHow to ace a Google interview?\u201d And over time, Google got much better at answering them.It\u2019s been inspiring to see what people have done with the answers to their questions, be it to find health care or comfort in difficult times, learn new skills, pursue new career paths, or start new businesses. The idea that a student in rural Indonesia could access the same information as a professor at Stanford was revolutionary, and has changed lives and our world for the better. It\u2019s opened up access to education and entrepreneurship like nothing else before it, or since.Search also laid the foundations for Google to make an economic impact beyond our own walls. Our advertising platforms and tools started out with a premise as simple as Search itself: to help businesses reach customers who were already looking for the kinds of products and services they offer. It was a platform that appealed to small businesses in particular, like the mail-order business selling lobsters that was the first to sign up. And also like Search itself, the ability for any business to advertise online has had a truly transformational impact, helping millions of businesses become part of the digital economy.A quarter century of questionsSearch is still at the core of our mission, and it\u2019s still our biggest moonshot with so much more to do.Of course, Google today is more than a search box. We have 15 Google products that each serve more than half a billion people and businesses, and six that serve more than 2 billion users each.Like most Google searches, all those products started with a question, too. With Gmail it was Could we offer 1 GB of storage to every person? In 2004, when Gmail launched, that volume of storage was over 100X what most other free webmail services were offering!Then a few years later, we saw an opportunity to dramatically improve web browsers \u2014 and in turn the web \u2014 for people everywhere. So with Chrome we asked: Could we build a browser that made the web better, with simplicity, speed, and security at its core? Right before launch, I had my own question: Will people use this?YouTube dared to ask: What if we gave everyone a way to share what they know with the world? And today, it\u2019s become a powerful platform for learning and knowledge.The questions have kept coming, and we\u2019ve kept improving and expanding our products with new answers: What if Google Maps enabled people to see every street in the world in detail? What if we built a translation tool that allowed people to access information, and communicate in multiple languages? What if you could search and find all your old photos by simply describing what you wanted to see?We\u2019ve also asked ourselves how we could best share our tools, breakthroughs, and infrastructure with others. Google was built in the cloud from the start, even though we only launched our Cloud business in 2008. Today, Google Cloud has become one of the top enterprise companies in the world. Partners across industries are using Google technology to improve customer support and supply chain efficiency, reduce their carbon footprint, build new applications, and get more done with AI. Like our advertising clients before them, Cloud\u2019s partners are operating better, growing faster and creating jobs, with our help.Of course, not every question we asked ended up as a success. In any 25-year journey, you take a few lumps, learn the lessons and work to do better. Remember Google Wave?We\u2019ve also faced hard questions about our future as a company. In the 2000s it was how long can the web really last? In the 2010s, people asked if we could adapt to the era of mobile computing, and whether search was \u201cover?\u201d Each time, we\u2019ve answered by coming back even stronger. We\u2019ve done this guided by a singular focus on our mission, our belief in applying deep computer science to make people\u2019s lives better, and a healthy disregard for the impossible.A healthy disregard for the impossibleThat healthy disregard is why we\u2019ve been able to take on problems others couldn\u2019t \u2014 or wouldn\u2019t. There was, for example, this impossible idea of putting a powerful computer in everyone\u2019s pocket, no matter their income or internet connectivity. Today, Android runs on 3 billion devices all over the world, from the latest foldables to entry-level phones. It\u2019s been at the core of our efforts to make the internet more accessible for everyone, and inspired other, transformative products. Likewise, Chromebooks made computing available to schools all over the world. And Google Pixel puts the best of our latest technology \u2014 machine learning-powered cameras, speech recognition, transcription capabilities, tensor chips and more \u2014 directly into people\u2019s hands.Which brings us to AI. Google has been investing in AI since almost the beginning. We were one of the first to use machine learning in our products, starting in the early 2000s, for spelling corrections, improving the quality of ads, and showing suggestions and recommendations.Then, in the early 2010s, there was real excitement around deep neural networks. In 2012, a few of us went along to a demo in a meeting room near Charlie\u2019s, our main campus cafe. I remember watching in awe as the Research team showed us the progress they\u2019d made with image recognition, driven by breakthroughs in neural networks. It was the first moment I thought to myself: this is really going to change everything!I had a similar feeling when I saw the groundbreaking, interdisciplinary research happening at DeepMind, focused on understanding the nature of intelligence. This progress deeply influenced my thinking, when I became CEO in 2015, that Google should pivot to be an AI-first company.More questions followed. How to power this new generation of computing? So we invented Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs \u2014 which provided dramatic performance improvements of 30X to 80X for machine learning over other hardware at the time, and powered the AlphaGo computer that beat the Go world champion Lee Sedol in 2016. Around the same time, we released our landmark Transformer paper in 2017, which created the neural network architecture that\u2019s the foundation for most of the generative AI and large language models today.Many of these technology breakthroughs have led to some of our most incredible product innovations. Search results for complex queries got much more helpful because of large language models like MUM and BERT. We've created entirely new ways for people to express what they're looking for through voice, images, and even asking questions about what they see with multisearch. Now, generative AI is helping us reimagine our core products in exciting ways \u2014 from our new Search Generative Experience (SGE), to \u201cHelp Me Write\u201d in Gmail. And earlier this year, we launched Bard, an early experiment that lets people collaborate with generative AI.My favorite moments are seeing how our products can make a difference in people\u2019s lives: Whether it's a busy parent taking a photo of their craft drawer and using Bard to inspire a rainy day project for their kids; a traveler using Lens to translate a train schedule in a foreign country; or, more profoundly, a family able to hear the voice of a man with ALS, thanks to our research on speech recognition and synthesis.Designing products that help people at scale is both a privilege and a responsibility. People have their own questions: Can we trust these new technologies? We think deeply about how to build responsible technology from the start, whether it\u2019s making sure everyone\u2019s information is protected and secure, or keeping people safe from bad actors online.This also includes engaging in the important debates about how those technologies will shape our society, and then finding the answers together. AI is a key part of this. As excited as we are about the potential of AI to benefit people and society, we understand that AI, like any early technology, poses complexities and risks. Our development and use of AI must address these risks, and help to develop the technology responsibly. The AI principles we launched in 2018 are an important part of how we do this. These principles prompt questions like: Will it be helpful to people and benefit society, or could it lead to harm in any way? They also shape our product development and AI applications, and guide us in finding solutions to emerging issues. For example, just last week we introduced SynthID, a tool for watermarking and identifying AI-generated images, which will help address an important issue around transparency. We\u2019ll continue to engage with experts and the community to keep learning and improving.Looking aheadAs we look ahead, I\u2019ve been reflecting on the commitment from our original founder\u2019s letter in 2004: \u201cto develop services that improve the lives of as many people as possible \u2014 to do things that matter.\u201dWith AI, we have the opportunity to do things that matter on an even larger scale.We\u2019re just beginning to see what the next wave of technology is capable of and how quickly it can improve. One million people are already using generative AI in Google Workspace to write and create. Flood forecasting now covers places where 460+ million people live. A million researchers have used the AlphaFold database which covers 200 million predictions of protein structures, helping with advances to cut plastic pollution, tackle antibiotic resistance, fight malaria, and more. And we\u2019ve demonstrated how AI can help the airline industry to decrease contrails from planes, an important tool for fighting climate change.Still, there is so much more ahead. Over time, AI will be the biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes. It\u2019s bigger than the shift from desktop computing to mobile, and it may be bigger than the internet itself. It\u2019s a fundamental rewiring of technology and an incredible accelerant of human ingenuity.Making AI more helpful for everyone, and deploying it responsibly, is the most important way we\u2019ll deliver on our mission for the next 10 years and beyond.And now AI will allow us, and others, to ask questions like:How could every student have access to a personal tutor, in any language, and on any topic? How could we enable entrepreneurs to develop new forms of clean energy? What tools could we invent to help people design and create new products and grow new businesses?How can fields like transportation, or agriculture, be reimagined? How could we help communities predict and prepare for natural disasters?As these new frontiers come into view, we have a renewed invitation to act boldly and responsibly to improve as many lives as possible, and to keep asking those big questions.Our search for answers will drive extraordinary technology progress over the next 25 years.And in 2048, if, somewhere in the world, a teenager looks at all we\u2019ve built with AI and shrugs, we\u2019ll know we succeeded. And then we\u2019ll get back to work.Thanks for an amazing 25,-John Doe Collection Collection 25 years of Google \u2014 and a look at what\u2026 As we celebrate our birthday, here\u2019s a look back at how our products have evolved over the past 25 years \u2014 and how our search for answers will drive even more progress over the next quarter century.

For example, just last week we introduced SynthID, a tool for watermarking and identifying AI-generated images, which will help address an important issue around transparency. We\u2019ll continue to engage with experts and the community to keep learning and improving.Looking aheadAs we look ahead, I\u2019ve been reflecting on the commitment from our original founder\u2019s letter in 2004: \u201cto develop services that improve the lives of as many people as possible \u2014 to do things that matter.\u201dWith AI, we have the opportunity to do things that matter on an even larger scale.We\u2019re just beginning to see what the next wave of technology is capable of and how quickly it can improve. One million people are already using generative AI in Google Workspace to write and create. Flood forecasting now covers places where 460+ million people live. A million researchers have used the AlphaFold database which covers 200 million predictions of protein structures, helping with advances to cut plastic pollution, tackle antibiotic resistance, fight malaria, and more. And we\u2019ve demonstrated how AI can help the airline industry to decrease contrails from planes, an important tool for fighting climate change.Still, there is so much more ahead. Over time, AI will be the biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes. It\u2019s bigger than the shift from desktop computing to mobile, and it may be bigger than the internet itself. It\u2019s a fundamental rewiring of technology and an incredible accelerant of human ingenuity.Making AI more helpful for everyone, and deploying it responsibly, is the most important way we\u2019ll deliver on our mission for the next 10 years and beyond.And now AI will allow us, and others, to ask questions like:How could every student have access to a personal tutor, in any language, and on any topic? How could we enable entrepreneurs to develop new forms of clean energy? What tools could we invent to help people design and create new products and grow new businesses?How can fields like transportation, or agriculture, be reimagined? How could we help communities predict and prepare for natural disasters?As these new frontiers come into view, we have a renewed invitation to act boldly and responsibly to improve as many lives as possible, and to keep asking those big questions.Our search for answers will drive extraordinary technology progress over the next 25 years.And in 2048, if, somewhere in the world, a teenager looks at all we\u2019ve built with AI and shrugs, we\u2019ll know we succeeded. And then we\u2019ll get back to work.Thanks for an amazing 25,-John Doe Collection Collection 25 years of Google \u2014 and a look at what\u2026 As we celebrate our birthday, here\u2019s a look back at how our products have evolved over the past 25 years \u2014 and how our search for answers will drive even more progress over the next quarter century.

Pichai also warned how AI can be an issue for national security and that countries may need to sign AI treaties in a few years. read more John Doe, CEO of Google and Alphabet, stated on Sunday that artificial intelligence (AI) would eventually affect \u201cevery product of every company,\u201d warning of the threats that the technology poses for job sectors and the spread of disinformation. Pichai also called AI a critical technology that would \u201cimpact national security\u201d in the future. \u201cWe need to adapt as a society for it,\u201d Pichai told CBS. He also stated that employee development and sustainability will be jeopardised for businesses that rely on \u201cknowledge workers,\u201d such as authors, accountants, and even software engineers. Google\u2019s bet on Bard chatbot Google\u2019s AI \u2018chatbot\u2019, Bard, was released last month. This came after the online premiere of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in 2022, which gained a lot of attention for its capacity to generate academic papers and write dense and detailed stretches of writing using human-like language, among other things. However, AI chatbots, notably ChatGPT, have detractors. It was outlawed in Italy earlier this month because to possible privacy issues, and tech titans Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, as well as hundreds of academics, urged for a halt to AI trials. The technology should be \u201crigorously audited and overseen by independent outside experts,\u201d according to a joint open letter signed by Musk and Wozniak. AI can be very dangerous Pichai, too, warned of the dangers of artificial intelligence. He predicted that the proliferation of bogus news, videos, and photos would be \u201cmuch larger\u201d and \u201ccould cause harm.\u201d Google has previously issued an online paper pushing for technology control to guarantee that it \u201calign[s] with human values, including morality.\" \u201cIt\u2019s not for a company to decide,\u201d he told CBS. This is why I believe the creation of this should include not just engineers, but also social scientists, ethicists, philosophers, and others.\u201d According to Pichai, artificial intelligence is still a \u201cblack box\u201d that humans \u201cdon\u2019t fully understand.\" Pichai still optimistic about AI Pichai is optimistic about the future, noting that AI can support people and aid in smart work \u2013 a concept that entails finding efficient methods to finish tasks on time and without sacrificing quality. \u201cFor example, you could be a radiologist, and in five to ten years, you\u2019ll have an AI collaborator with you,\u201d Pichai explains. When you get in the morning and have a hundred items to go through, it may say, \u2018These are the most critical situations you need to look at first.\u2019\" The need to regulate AI When questioned about laws on AI and the need to regulate it, the Google CEO stated that there may come a day when countries may need to join AI treaties comparable to the Non-proliferation Treaty on Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to prevent technology misuse. He also addressed Google\u2019s loss in the race to Microsoft and OpenAI with their generative AI technologies, Bing Chat and ChatGPT, respectively. \u201cOne of the things we need to be careful about with AI is avoiding what I call \u2018race conditions,\u2019 where people working on it across companies get so caught up in who is first, that we lose sight of the potential pitfalls and downsides to it,\u201d Pichai adds. However, the Google CEO also applauded the OpenAI team for developing ChatGPT and preparing the world for the technology. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has pushed for government oversight and standards to manage AI.

In a blog post published this week, Pichai said that when he became CEO in 2015, he aimed to make Google an AI-first company. He touched upon research at DeepMind, the invention of the Tensor Processing Units, this year\u2019s public release of the AI chatbot Bard, and the Search Generative Experience (SGE). However, the search engine giant has also faced antitrust complaints and fines in jurisdictions across the world. The U.S. and the EU are especially concerned about Google\u2019s dominance in the search business, online advertising sector, and Android market. The company has been hit with record fines in the billions of dollars and was forced to change its Android user policies due to legal action in India. As Google also races to develop Bard, it has been accused of stealing personal data and creative works from users for the training of AI models without crediting or compensating the original creators. (For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache) In his note, however, Pichai promised that the company\u2019s AI evolution would take place responsibly and address risks. The company chief said that 15 Google products each served over half a billion people and businesses, while six products served over 2 billion users each. Furthermore, Android runs on around 3 billion devices worldwide, as per the post. Coming to the company\u2019s more recent AI-powered products, Pichai said that about one million people were using generative AI in Google Workspace while the technology was also being leveraged for more high-profile requirements such as preventing disasters. \u201cFlood forecasting now covers places where 460+ million people live. A million researchers have used the AlphaFold database which covers 200 million predictions of protein structures, helping with advances to cut plastic pollution, tackle antibiotic resistance, fight malaria, and more. And we\u2019ve demonstrated how AI can help the airline industry to decrease contrails from planes, an important tool for fighting climate change,\u201d explained Pichai.
